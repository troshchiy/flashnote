# Flashnote

Flashnote is a note-taking app that makes it easy to convert your notes into spaced repetition flashcards.

The building blocks are:

* Python 3.12
* Django 5
* PostgreSQL 16

## How it works?

The work area is divided into two columns: the note-taking column (on the right) and the questions/keyword column (on the left).
Notes from a lecture or text are written in the note-taking column.
To make a flashcard for future reviews, relevant questions or keywords are written in the left-hand column.
Only you decide which note will be turned into a flashcard, and which will remain only in the notes.

## Spaced repetition learning

Spaced repetition is a clever technique for remembering things long-term. 
With Flashnote, you practice just before you're likely to forget, which strengthens your memory.
As you practice more, you'll find you can wait longer between study sessions until you remember the info forever!

## Effective Study

The more you practice recalling information from memory, the better you remember it later. 
This explains why using flashcards or taking practice tests is more effective than simply reviewing your notes until they seem familiar.
